Features that work:
IO, piping, background, zombie killing, most environment commands, cd, quotes (sort of), tilde expansion, simple wildcarding, ctrl-C, exit, some environment expansion

Features that DO NOT work:
complex wildcarding, source, subshell, readline (it was extremely buggy so i removed it completely)
